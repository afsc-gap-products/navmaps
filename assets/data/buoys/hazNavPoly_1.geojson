This threat is located in Barry Arm and has the potential to create a tsunami if/when a landslide is generated that impacts the water in Barry Arm.  If/when this occurs localized wave heights will be very hazardous in Barry Arm and Harriman Fjord.  Port Wells and Passage Canal will also see inundation and strong, unusual currents for hours following an event.  The geologic makeup of the area is similar to Alaskan locations where two previous landslide caused tsunamis occurred, in Lituya Bay (1958) and Icy Bay (2015), both causing extremely large but localized tsunamis.  Mariners should maintain vigilance when in the vicinity of Barry Arm or nearby waters and be prepared to depart the area if any unusual geologic activity is observed.  Studies are being conducted and the situation is being monitored to allow for a better understanding of the potential results of a slide.
