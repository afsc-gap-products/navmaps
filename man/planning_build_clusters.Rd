\title{Build station clusters based on minimum transit distance}
\usage{
planning_build_clusters(nodes, max_stations = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{An `sf` object containing station locations as POINT geometries.}

\item{max_stations}{Number of stations per cluster.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row represents a starting station, with additional columns:
	 - `station_rank`: The sampling order of station within its cluster.
	 - `cumulative_distance_km`: Cumulative transit distance within the cluster.
	 - `sequential_index`: The index of stations in the cluster.
}
\description{
This function groups nodes (stations) into clusters based on their proximity, ensuring that each cluster contains `max_stations`. A cluster is created for each station, and clustering is done by iteratively selecting the nearest unvisited station.
